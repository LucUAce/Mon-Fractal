# MÃ³n Fractal

Here is my Baccalaureate Final Project, "MÃ³n Fractal" (Catalan). Please don't judge it too harshly, it was done when I was 16 or 17!

In the "Annex digital" folder you will find C and Scratch programs that generate linear and complex fractals, respectively. 

The C programs generate a file listing points in the plane or the space (its coordinates). Use Gnuplot or similar software to visualize the resulting linear fractal! :point_down:

I've updated the Scratch files to the .sb3 format (they used to be .sb2!); hopefully, everything still works as expected! Don't forget to activate "Turbo mode"! Even so, generating an image can take several minutes, but it's worth it! ðŸ‘‡

More details on the programs and audio files are provided in the PDF.
