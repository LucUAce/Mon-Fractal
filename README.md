# MÃ³n Fractal

Here is my Baccalaureate Final Project, "MÃ³n Fractal" (Catalan). Please don't judge it too harshly, it was done when I was 16 or 17!

In the "Annex digital" folder you will find C and Scratch programs that generate linear and complex fractals, respectively. 

The C programs generate a file listing points in the plane or the space (its coordinates). Use Gnuplot or similar software to visualize the resulting linear fractal! :point_down:

I've updated the Scratch files to the .sb3 format (they used to be .sb2!); hopefully, everything still works as expected! Don't forget to activate "Turbo mode"! Even so, generating an image can take several minutes, but it's worth it! ðŸ‘‡
