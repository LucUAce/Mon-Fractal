# Món Fractal

Here is my Baccalaureate Final Project, "Món Fractal" (Catalan). Please don't judge it too harshly, it was done when I was 16 or 17, and I haven't touched it since!

In the "Annex digital" folder you will find C and Scratch programs that generate linear and complex fractals. 
The Scratch files are in the .sb2 format, which is outdated, but I believe they can still be opened and updated with the latest version of Scratch. 

More details on the programs and audio files are provided in the PDF.
